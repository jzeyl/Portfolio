## Data Viz
### [Data Visualizations (R, Python, SQL)](https://github.com/jzeyl/Data-visualizations)
Series of static visualizations I made from public data sources
  * Working with maps in R    
  * Using SQL queries
  * 3D visualizations in R 'rgl' package

###[Dashboards]
  * A [Shiny app](https://jeff-zeyl.shinyapps.io/shiny_rent_app/?_ga=2.107511364.7932263.1627397886-968041279.1627397886)  


 ### [Inventory App (Python, SQL)](https://github.com/jzeyl/Inventory-app):snake:
 An app to update an inventory spreadsheet based on a separate sales/estimate spreadsheet. This was done as a pure python program (using pandas, tkinter, datetime, and seaborn libraries) and with equivalent SQL commands.
 
### Interactive visualizations and dashboards
Weather app using python, flask, d3 to lookup and plot the current temperature in a Canadian city (using API from https://www.weatherbit.io/):

## Scientific computing
### [AcousticCalcs](https://github.com/jzeyl/AcousticCalcs)
A set of convenience functions for common calculations in acoustics and audiometry in R.

## Working with 3D data (microCT scan data)
### [Ear Measures (R)](https://github.com/jzeyl/Ear-Measures)
These are a set of R scripts that automate the I/O and run calculations on 3D coordinate files, run a series of measurements (compute distances, surface areas, angles)
### [Scripts to automate tasks in 3D Slicer (Python)](https://github.com/jzeyl/3D-Slicer-Scripts):snake:
These are a collection of scripts I ran through the [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) Python interpreter to automate commands normally done through the GUI. 

## Statistics
### [Phylogenetic regressions (R)](https://github.com/jzeyl/A-T-Statistics)  
These analyses accompany a manuscript comparing anatomy between different aquatic and terrestrial birds. Scripts include phylogenetic methods (regression, PCA), and mapping traits on phylogenies.
### [Extract measures for comparative audiograms (R)](https://github.com/jzeyl/Scaling_2021)
These analyses accompany a manuscript examing scaling of ear anatomy across animal sizes. In addition to phylogenetic regressions, analyses automate the extraction of measurements from audiogram curves.
