# Portfolio

## [Data Visualisations](https://github.com/jzeyl/Data-visualizations)
*R | Python | Tableau | Shiny*  
A series of static visualizations, dashboards, and animations generated mostly from various from public data sources using R, Python. All data fetching, cleaning, and plotting done 100% with code.

## Statistics
*R*  
* [Phylogenetic regressions](https://github.com/jzeyl/A-T-Statistics) - These analyses accompany a manuscript comparing anatomy between different aquatic and terrestrial birds. Scripts include phylogenetic methods (regression, PCA), and mapping traits on phylogenies.
* [Extract measures for comparative audiograms](https://github.com/jzeyl/Scaling_2021) - These analyses accompany a manuscript examing scaling of ear anatomy across animal sizes. In addition to phylogenetic regressions, analyses automate the extraction of measurements from audiogram curves.

## SQL queries and databases
*Python | SQL*  
Projects using SQL and relational databases

* [BigQuery weather project](https://github.com/jzeyl/SQL-Bigquery-Weather)
* [Inventory command line app](https://github.com/jzeyl/Inventory-app). A small app to update an inventory spreadsheet based on a separate salesspreadsheet. The same task was done using pure python programming and with equivalent SQL commands and GUI created with tkinter.
## Scientific Computing
*R | Python*  
* [AcousticCalcs](https://github.com/jzeyl/AcousticCalcs) - A set of convenience functions for common calculations in acoustics and audiometry in R.
* [Ear Measures](https://github.com/jzeyl/Ear-Measures) - A set of R scripts that automate analysis on on 3D coordinate files, including data import, running a series of measurements(compute distances, surface areas, angles).
* [3D Slicer automation](https://github.com/jzeyl/3D-Slicer-Scripts):snake: Python scripts automating various commands normally done through the GUI of [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/). To be run in the built-in Python interpreter. 


 

## [Web App](http://jzeyl87.pythonanywhere.com/) 
*Flask | d3.js*  
A simple weather app created with the help of Flask, d3.js. Looks up and plots the current temperature in a Canadian city using weather api from https://www.weatherbit.io/ and geocoding from simplemaps.com:
