## [Data Visualisations](https://github.com/jzeyl/Data-visualizations)
*R | Python | SQL| Web scraping | Tableau | Shiny*  
A series of static visualizations, dashboards, and animations primarily created from public data sources using R, Python, SQL, web-scraping tools.

## [Inventory command line app](https://github.com/jzeyl/Inventory-app)
*Python | SQL*  
 A command line app to update an inventory spreadsheet based on a separate salesspreadsheet. The same task was done using pure python programming (using pandas, tkinter, datetime, and seaborn libraries) and with equivalent SQL commands.
 
## [Web App](http://jzeyl87.pythonanywhere.com/) 
*Flask | d3.js*  
A simple weather app created with the help of Flask, d3.js. Looks up and plots the current temperature in a Canadian city using weather api from https://www.weatherbit.io/ and geocoding from simplemaps.com:



## Scientific Computing
* [AcousticCalcs](https://github.com/jzeyl/AcousticCalcs) - A set of convenience functions for common calculations in acoustics and audiometry in R.
* [Ear Measures (R)](https://github.com/jzeyl/Ear-Measures) - These are a set of R scripts that automate the I/O and run calculations on 3D coordinate files, run a series of measurements (compute distances, surface areas, angles)
* [3D Slicer Python automation functions)](https://github.com/jzeyl/3D-Slicer-Scripts):snake: -These are a collection of scripts I ran through the [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/) Python interpreter to automate commands normally done through the GUI. 

## Statistics
* [Phylogenetic regressions (R)](https://github.com/jzeyl/A-T-Statistics) - These analyses accompany a manuscript comparing anatomy between different aquatic and terrestrial birds. Scripts include phylogenetic methods (regression, PCA), and mapping traits on phylogenies.
* [Extract measures for comparative audiograms (R)](https://github.com/jzeyl/Scaling_2021) - These analyses accompany a manuscript examing scaling of ear anatomy across animal sizes. In addition to phylogenetic regressions, analyses automate the extraction of measurements from audiogram curves.
