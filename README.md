## [Data Visualisations](https://github.com/jzeyl/Data-visualizations)
*R | Python | Tableau | Shiny*  
A series of static visualizations, dashboards, and animations generated mostly from various from public data sources using R, Python. All data fetching, cleaning, and plotting done 100% with code.

## Statistics
*R*  
* [Zeyl-et-al-2022-Sci-Rep](https://github.com/jzeyl/A-T-Statistics) - These analyses accompany a [paper published in Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-09090-3?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_content=organic&utm_term=null&utm_campaign=CONR_41598_AWA1_GL_PHSS_BRAND_OAXOrganic) comparing anatomy between different aquatic and terrestrial birds. Scripts include statistical analyses(regression, PCA) controlled for phylogenetic relatedness, and mapping traits on phylogenies.
* [Zeyl-et-al-2023-Hearing-Research](https://github.com/jzeyl/Scaling_2021) - Analyses for [a research article published in Hearing Research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378595522002477?dgcid=author) examing scaling of bird ear anatomy across animal sizes. In addition to phylogenetic regressions, analyses automate the extraction of measurements from audiogram curves. Various audiogram plots as well.

## SQL, databases, CRUD operations
*Python | SQL*  
Projects using SQL and relational databases

* [BigQuery weather project](https://github.com/jzeyl/SQL-Bigquery-Weather)
* [Inventory command line app](https://github.com/jzeyl/Inventory-app). A small app to update an inventory spreadsheet based on a separate salesspreadsheet. The same task was done using pure python programming and with equivalent SQL commands and GUI created with tkinter.
## Scientific Computing
*R | Python*  
* [3D Slicer automation](https://github.com/jzeyl/3D-Slicer-Scripts):snake: Python scripts automating various commands normally done through the GUI of [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/). To be run in the built-in Python interpreter. 
* [AcousticCalcs](https://github.com/jzeyl/AcousticCalcs) - A set of convenience functions for common calculations in acoustics and audiometry in R.
* [Ear Measures](https://github.com/jzeyl/Ear-Measures) - A set of R scripts that automate analysis on on 3D coordinate files, including data import, running a series of measurements(compute distances, surface areas, angles).
* [ImageJ Macro Scripts](https://github.com/jzeyl/imageJ-macros) - Scripts written using the imageJ macro language
